AmbientNotifications-Arduino
============================

An ambient light notification for Android - (iOS coming soon). Built using Arduino Uno, Red Bear Lab BLE Shield, Android Studio, and WS2812B LED Strip.

At the end you'll see the light change to blue upon getting a notification. The color will change depending on the app. In this case it was Inbox by Gmail. For example, it would be yellow for snapchat and red for Google+.

There are 2 arduino files here.
AmbientNotificationsStrip.ino is if you have a WS2812B LED strip
and AmbientNotification.ino is if you just have an RGB LED.

Huge thanks to Red Bear Lab and Pololu for the Android and Arduino libraries. Would've taken me years to figure out and right libraries for bluetooth low energy, arduino, and the led strip.
